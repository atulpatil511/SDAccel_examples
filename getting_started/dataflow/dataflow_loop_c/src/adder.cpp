Description: 
    HLS Loop Dataflow Example using HLS Stream datatype. 
    This is example of vector addition to demonstrate HLS Dataflow Pragma 
    functionality to perform multiple loops parallelism using HLS Stream datatype. 
    HLS dataflow pragma instruct compiler to run loops concurrently. Loops can 
    transfer the data using hls stream. In this Example a vector addition 
    implementation is divided into three loops as below:

    1) Loop1:Memory Read 
        This Loop reads the input vector from Global Memory and writes it into 
        HLS Stream 'inStream' using blocking write command.

    2) Loop2: Execution Loop 
        This Loop reads the input vector from 'inStream' using blocking
        read command and increment the each vector element by user specified value.
        It writes the results into 'outStream' using blocking write command.

    3) Loop3: Memory Write
        This Loop reads the result vector from 'outStream' using blocking read
        command and write the result into Global Memory Location.


     Loop Dataflow based Adder will be implemented as below:
                     _____________
                    |             |<----- Input Vector from Global Memory
                    |   loop1:    |

                    |_____________|----->|  |
                     _____________       |  | inStream
                    |             |<-----|__|
                    |   loop2:    |
                    |  (execute)  |       __

                    |   loop3:    |
                    |  (mem_wr)   |       
                    |_____________|-----> Output result to Global Memory

//  blocking write command from producer will go into wait state until consumer 
//  reads some elements from stream. Similarly if Stream is empty (no element in Stream)
//  any blocking read command from consumer will go into wait state until producer
//  writes elements to Stream. This blocking read and write allow consumer and 
//  producer to synchronize each other.
